# Parameter-Finder
It Can Be Very Useful In Case Of Finding Parameters Of Php Files In A Site

### P.S ~ For SQL Injectors :D
Specially For Me :3 

### Working:
It Just Downloads a dom.php File and you dont need to do anything but just keep sitting and typing
php crawler.php -u yoururlhere.com

### Note
Beware of Adding http:// Before the url or it wont work :) ^_^

### Output:
